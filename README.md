Sales and Customer Analytics Project

Customer Demographics:
Explore the distribution of customer ages, genders, and income levels to understand the composition of the customer base. Compare demographic profiles across different customer segments (e.g., Regular vs. Premium) to identify any notable differences.

Transaction Patterns:
Analyze the monthly and yearly trends in total transactions and revenue to uncover seasonal patterns in purchasing behavior or sales fluctuations.

Product Analysis:
Investigate which product categories, brands, and types contribute the most to revenue and total sales volume. Determine the popularity of products based on the total number of purchases.

Sales Performance:
Examine how the total amount spent varies by payment method and shipping method. Calculate average order values for different customer segments and shipping methods.

Order Status and Feedback:
Understand the distribution of order statuses (e.g., Shipped, Processing, Delivered) and explore correlations between customer ratings/feedback scores and spending or product categories purchased.

Geographic Analysis:
Evaluate variations in sales and customer demographics across different geographical regions (country, state, city). Identify regions contributing significantly to revenue or showing higher customer satisfaction.

Temporal Analysis:
Explore transaction times to identify peak periods during the day or days of the week with higher transaction volumes. Analyze purchase frequencies and amounts across months and years.

Customer Retention:
Calculate the average number of total purchases per customer and compare across different customer segments. Investigate patterns in repeat purchases and churn rates among various customer demographics.

Product Performance:
Assess which products receive the highest and lowest average ratings. Analyze the impact of shipping and payment methods on product satisfaction and customer feedback.

Correlation Analysis:
Identify significant correlations between customer demographics (e.g., age, income) and spending behavior. Investigate relationships between product categories/brands and customer ratings/feedback.
